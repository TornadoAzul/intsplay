You were the reason I fell in love with technology, the reason I became passionate about radio, and the reason I loved to keep everything in its place. You were the only person who, amidst everything, listened to me. You were my hero in my childhood, not just mine, but also my mom's, your talented daughter. You asked me to spread the word of God. I promised you, and through this means, I fulfill my word. Thank you for being my hero. From this earthly plane, with my hand on my heart, together with family, your colleagues, and all those you impacted with your being, I thank you. Some called you KP4-LRA, but today, I call you abuelo."
